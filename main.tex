\section{Topological space}

A topological space is defined as the pair \(\rb{T,\nu}\) where \(T\) is a set and \(\nu : T \to \pw{T}\) is a function, called \textbf{neighbourhood topology}, which has to satisfy the following axioms.
The elements of \(T\) are called \textbf{points} and, given a point \(x\) the elements of \(\nu(x)\) are called \textbf{neighbourhoods} of \(x\).

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{TS.\arabic*}]
  \item A neighbourhood of a point must contain the point itself.
  \item All supersets of a neighbourhood of a point are neighbourhoods of that point.
  \item The intersection of two neighbourhoods of the same point is a neighbourhood of that point.
  \item Any neighbourhood \(n\) of a point must contain another neighbourhood \(m\) of the same point, such that \(n\) is a neighbourhood of all points in \(m\).
\end{enumerate}

We can restate the axioms in formal terms.
For brevity it is implied that \(x, y \in T\) and \(n, m \in \pw{T}\).

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{TS.\arabic*}]
  \item \(\forall x \forall n : n \in \nu(x) \to x \in n\)
  \item \(\forall x \forall n \forall m : \rb{n \in \nu(x) \land n \subseteq m} \to m \in \nu(x)\)
  \item \(\forall x \forall n \forall m : \rb{n \in \nu(x) \land m \in \nu(x)} \to n \cap m \in \nu(x)\)
  \item \(\forall x \forall n \exists m \forall y : \rb{n \in \nu(x) \land m \subseteq n \land m \in \nu(x) \land y \in m} \to n \in \nu(y)\)
\end{enumerate}

If \(\rb{T,\nu}\) is a topological space, we say that \(u \in \pw{T}\) is \textbf{open} if it is a neighbourhood of all the points it contains.
Restating this in formal terms, \(u\) is open if:
%
\[\forall x : x \in u \to u \in \nu(x)\]
%
We say that \(u \in \pw{\mathfrak{T}}\) is \textbf{closed} if its complement \(\cmpl{u}\) is open.
It is important to remark that the two definitions are not mutually exclusive, a set could be both open and closed, in which case itâ€™s usually called a clopen set.
